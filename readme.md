# miMartillo.com mobile client for Android

This is the Android mobile client of <a href="http://www.mimartillo.com" target="_blank"><b>miMartillo.com</b></a>, the Senior Year Project for my Master's degree in Computer Science. It was developed during the 2016 course and also covers the backend services, using PHP and MySQL.

miMartillo.com is a mobile app for Android 4.1+ to put in touch both suppliers and demanders in the sphere of the Works, Reforms and Home services sector. Users can interact with the system as private users (where they can publish work offers and search for professionals in the nearby) or as professional users (where they can advertise themselves and search for works that fit their skills).

A more detailed description of the features is available in the app website.

### Additional considerations:

The code in the repository does not include the keystore file needed to sign a release version of the app, only the debug version. More information on this topic is available <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.

### To-Do list:

- Adapt the UI to Material Design.
- In the New Work form, replace the Google Places picker with a custom location picker.
- Use different asynchronous tasks to download the JSON data and the images (requires to make changes in the backend services as well).
- Paginate search results (requires to make changes in the backend services as well).
